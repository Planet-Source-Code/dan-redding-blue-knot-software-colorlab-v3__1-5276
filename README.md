## ColorLab v3

### Description

The previous ColorLab (still on this site) was a color picker/sampler/mixer that displayed HTML & VB Hex codes (among other things...). This one does that PLUS you can now: >> Save, Load, Print & Export your favorite colors >> Generate HTML Color charts from your favorites >> Load a GIF or JPG and see it with your color as a background (yes, transparency works) >> Find the 'average' color of the loaded GIF or JPG. It also demonstrates how to move 'floating toolbar' window when the main window is moved (not MDI windows). Plus, I added some simple 'help' pop-ups and re-labeled the controls to make it easier to use. Again, thanks to Matt Hart & others here whose work I built on for parts of this.
 
### More Info
 
Colors selected by Color Dialog, Screen Sampling, or RGB/HSL Values

This is a full blown program that should be as useful as an application as source code.

VB & HTML Hex Codes to screen, clipboard or disk; HTML color charts

Sampling routine may not function correctly with some versions of Win95.
